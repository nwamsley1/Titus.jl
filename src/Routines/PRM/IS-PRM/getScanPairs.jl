    getScanPairs(H::Vector{T}, L::Vector{T}; max_diff::T = T(3)) where T <: Number

Given sorted lists of retention times of MSN scans for the heavy and light precursor respectively, aligns
the two list. Returns two list of indices, `heavy_scans` and `light_scans`, for `H` and `L` respectively of equal length. 
heavy_scans[i] is paired with light_scans[i]. Each heavy scan is paired with its nearest light scan by retention time
given the difference bewteen the two is less than `max_diff` (in minutes). 

### Input

- `H::Vector{T}` -- Sorted (ascending) retention time for MSn scans targeting the heavy precursor
- `L::Vector{T}` -- Sorted (ascending) retention time for MSn scans targeting the light precursor
- `max_diff::T = T(3)` -- Maximum allowable difference in retention time (minutes) bewteen a paired light and heavy scan


### Output
- Returns a tuple (heavy_scans, light_scans). Tuple{Vector{Int64}, Vector{Int64}}. These are of equal length and have
1:1 correspondance. heavy_scans[i] corresponds to light_scans[i]. The vectors contain scan indices. The i'th heavy
scan was nearest the i'th light scan, so the two are "paired".
